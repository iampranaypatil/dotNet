	SDM:
	    ECommerce Solution 
			Plan, Gather,  Analyze, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy
	    SDLC Phases 
		1.Requirement Gathering
				Bussiness Requirement Specification (BRS)
				Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
		Analysis
				OOA
				Abstraction, Encapsulation,
				Modularity, Coupling
				Software  + data

		Design
				Data:
				     DFD-----Data Flow Diagram
				     UML-----Unified Modelling Diagrams
						Use Case Diagram
						Sequence Diagram

	________________________________________________________________	
		Development
				
			
			Creating Solutoin
				Creating Projects
					Adding references to external libraries
					Classes,Interface, Delegate, Events

	    	Waterfall Model

		Spiral Model
		      Agile Methodology
	asp.net Security
	
	ECommerce Application:
	
	Web Based Application
Online Application
	Functional Requirement
		Product Catalog
		Shopping Cart managment
		Order Processing
		Customer Relationship Managment(CRM)
		Payment Processing
		Shipment
	
	Non Functional Requirement

		1.Scalability---------container solution
		2.Durability----------Cloud Computing(EC2 instance)
		3.State Management-----Session
		4.Responsiveness-------
			Dependency injection of Services
			Reduce round trips client & server
		 	(SPA --React)---asynchronous rest api calling
		 	+(Web API Controllers)----using layered archiecture
						  with services integration
			For bulk data manipulation shift logic to Stored Procedures

		5.Integrtity
			   Reusable Libraries
			   Layered Architecture
			   Use DRY, KISS
			   Decoupled Solution  with the help of requable libaries
		6.Security


		Security within application is implmented using 


			a. Authenticaion
				Who are you ?
				Identify User
			
			b. Authorization
				Are you eligible to Access functionality ?
				Are you member of Security Group
					Security Group is defiend by Roles
					Each Role will have persmission levels
					Each permisssion in permission level with allow or deny Access


		Each authenticated User should submit claim  to request for Secure Web Access

		Claim :

			Claim Based Authentication


		How do you implment Authentication & Authourization in Asp.net 

ASP.NET Framework:
	Different Types of Authentication

	1.Windows Authentication
		Windows Server Operating System will maintain User Credentials in  active directory
		Each organization keeps one dedicated server for storing User and Groups information
		such server is called as Domain Controller
				domain controller consist of Active Directory

		Whenever asp.net framwork application is deployed to  IIS  Web Server
		IIS is integrated Webserver alongwith Windows Server Operating System


	2.Form based Authentication
		In Request Response life cycle of asp.net framework application; requrest are pass through 
		HTTP Pipeline.

		HTTP Pipline is made up of set of HTTP modules which intercepts incomming requests and 
		intercpets outgoing responses.

		in ASP.net Framework pipeline AuthenticationModule is responsible for redirecting incomming 
		request for authencation purpose to login.aspx or Login action method of as.net framework
		
		in web.config
			
			<authentication  mode="Forms/>

	3.Passport Authentication
		Authentication provider will be responsible for verifying clients credentials.
		Authentcation provides are Microsoft, Google , FaceBook,..........
		Token based Authencation:

		Web Token:
		   OAuth Token
		JWT Token
		
		JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard 
		for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption
		whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. 
		The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.



	ASP.NET Core

		Web Application consist of Set of reusable REST API
		Secure Web API
			means calling client request will be  process based on claim submitted by calling person/ application
		asp.ner core application should implement  JWT Token Authentication


		Web Application could be 

			B--2--C ( Bussiness to  Consumer)------- MVC Application-------
			B--2--C ( Bussiness to Bussiness )------ MVC Application --------accessing -------Web API



Steps to implment JWT Token for asp.net core Application
	1.Create asp.net coer Web API Project.
	2.Add JWT Token Dependency Refernces
			using Visual studio : 
			Go to dependencies 
			Add references to following packages using Nugget Package manager
			using dotnet add package command  ( using vs code and .net core runtime)
			
			Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
			Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi
			System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
			Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer

	3.Add WebAPI Controller UsersController
	4.Add POST, GET action methods to UsersController
			Authenticate
			GetAll
			GetById
	5.Add Entities to Web API project
			User.cs
			Role.cs file
	6.Add Services folder to UsersController
			a.Add IUserService Interface with method declaration
			b.Add UserService class implementing IUserService Inteface
			c.Implemnt logic for each Interface method.
			d.Define List<Users> with their personal details and password
			e.Add Logic to generate JWTToken after validating user credential from users List
			
 









					



 



		
			Passport Authentication
					(Facebook authentication,
					 Google authentication,
					 Outlook authentication)
